Problem 1: a. Make a table or list of all the models from class and the
last one you constructed on your own. Write a caption for your table. (8
points)

```{r}
# comparing models
modelsummary::modelsummary( # this function takes a list of models
  list( 
    "null" = model0, # "model name" = model object
    "model 1" = model1,
    "model 2" = model2,
    "model 3" = model3,
    "model 4" = model4
  )
)
```

Table: In your table, each row should be a model with the model number
(1, 2, 3, etc.) and the predictors for each model.

Caption: table captions typically go above the table. Number the table
and provide a title. Describe what is in the table (columns and rows).

Table 1: Model summary of effects on total biomass of Native Plants.

Each row corresponds to a model, one with no predictors (null), model 1
is the saturated model with all three predictors, SLA, water treatment,
and species. Model 2 contains SLA and water treatment. Model 3 contains
SLA and species. Model 4 contains water treatment and species. The
intercept row shows the reference value. For our three predictor
variables, the corresponding slope is shown for each model, if all other
variables are held constant. This value shows the change in biomass that
variable had on the plant in comparison to the reference. Because some
of the models do not contain all of the predictor variables, some cells
are shown empty (ie Model 2 won't have values for any of the species as
it only includes SLA and water treatment.)

b.  Write a 5-6 sentence “statistical methods” section. (8 points) Your
    answer should be in paragraph form and include:

how you addressed the central question(s) (i.e. to examine the influence
of \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_ on \_\_\_\_\_, I…) how you chose the
final model (i.e. to determine the model that best described \_\_\_\_,
I…) how you visually determined that your final model conformed to the
assumptions of a linear model (i.e. to evaluate linear model
assumptions, I…)

Methods:

To examine the influence of Specific leaf area (SLA), water treatment,
and species type on total biomass, . We conducted some exploratory
visualization to see any immediate trends on our data like which species
has the highest mean biomass, which water treatment corresponded to a
higher biomass and if there was a correlation between SLA and biomass
using a scatter plot and Pearson's r. We then constructed 5 models,
including our null model, saturated model and the three models
containing a unique combination of two predictors. To evaluate these
models, we first evaluated their diagnostics, finding no trends or
outliers that would affect our data. To determine the model that best
described the effect on total biomass, we produced AIC values for each
model, finding that model 4, using species and water treatment a
predictors was the model that showed the relationship with total biomass
the best. We then produced a visualization of the effects of water
treatment, and species on total biomass.

c.  Make a visualization of the model predictions with underlying data
    for your “best” model. (20 points) Show and annotate all your code.
    For full credit:

make the underlying data more transparent than the model predictions
display species names in full (not as species codes like ENCCAL or
ESCCAL) display water treatment types in full (not as WW or DS)
represent well-watered and drought stressed treatments with different
colors use colors that are not the default ggplot() colors facet your
plot by species remove the legend finalize the plot

d.  Write a caption for your visualization. (6 points) Include a data
    citation.

e.  Write a 3-4 sentence results section. (10 points) Your answer should
    be in paragraph form and address the following points:

what predictors “best” described total mass (include model statistics
here)? on average, what differences did you find between water
treatments? on average, what differences did you find between species?

Problem 2:

a.  Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like
    for your personal data (3-5 sentences). (2 points)

    To affectively visualize my personal data, I was thinking of doing
    something similar to the Dear Data project. I would make an entry
    everyday of the week, inclusing symbols that describe my data. Each
    entry would signify a day and how many times I went to the arbor,
    how many times I visited the grass, as well as if I was was with
    friends or not.

b.  Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea. (2 points) Include a photo
    of this sketch in your submission.

c.  Make a draft of your visualization. (12 points) Feel free to be
    creative with this! You do not have to do this in R. You could
    create a sculpture, painting, textile object, etc.

If you are making your visualization outside of R, include a photo of
your visualization in your submission.

d.  Write an artist statement. (8 points) An artist statement gives the
    audience context to understand your work. Write 4-5 sentences to
    address:

the content of your piece (what are you showing?) the influences (what
did techniques/artists/etc. did you find influential in creating your
work?) the form of your work (written code, watercolor, oil painting,
etc.) your process (how did you create your work?)

This piece is showing the frequency in which I visit the Arbor and grass
in front of the UCSB library respectively, as well as if I visited those
places with friends or alone. It is separated by day of the week with a
separate row for each week. Each fish tank corresponds to one day, fish
type corresponds either the Arbor (orange), or the grass (green), and a
top hat signifies that I was with friends during that visit. I created
this piece digitally on the platform Canva. It was influenced by the
Dear Data postcard project where different things were tracked and
documented on a postcard using symbols.

Problem 3:

a. Revisit and summarize (6 points) What are the statistical tests the
authors are using to address their main research question?

The authors used a Mann-Whitney-U Test to evaluate differences in the
use of altitude ranges
by both snow and common leopards to determine how much their
geographical ranges overlap. They also compiled data from studies
depicting the diets of each leopard and summarized it to describe how
much of each leopards diet consists of a certain group of prey to
explore the overlap in the two predators diets. All to determine the
likelihood of competition between two species that used to be separated
by thousands of feet in elevation.

b.  Visual clarity (10 points) How clearly did the authors visually
    represent their statistics in figures? For example, are the x- and
    y-axes in a logical position? Do they show summary statistics (means
    and SE, for example) and/or model predictions, and if so, do they
    show the underlying data?

    Fig 1 is kind of difficult to digest as you have to refer back and
    forth between two maps to see where the species overlap and what
    their diet consists of. The pie charts represent the composition of
    the leopard's diet in each location using the frequency of
    occurrence of prey type.

    Fig 2 is much clearer in communicating the data. The axes are clear
    and labeled, the bars are shaded based on species and the error bars
    are easy to see. They are showing the means and standard error for
    the prey weight categories % relative frequency of occurrence. The
    did not include the underlying data.

c.  Aesthetic clarity (10 points) How well did the authors handle
    “visual clutter”? How would you describe the the data:ink ratio?

    Fig 1 has too much visual clutter in my opinion. The borders of the
    maps where the leopards don't live is distracting. The numbers
    corresponding to each study area/pie chart could be mistaken for
    something else if you don't read the caption carefully. Having two
    maps to look back and forth between seems like too much clutter. I
    would say there is too much ink in the data:ink ratio.

    Fig 2 is a clean figure. It presents the data clearly and is not
    complicated to see the trends. I think it passes the data:ink ratio
    test.

d.  Recommendations (can be longer than 4 sentences, 10 points) What
    recommendations would you make to make the figure better? What would
    you take out, add, or change? Provide explanations/justifications
    for each of your recommendations.

My main recommendation would be to make one map, with two different
shadings for each leopards geographic range and each study site labeled.
And then paired with that they could include plots faceted by study site
or elevation, comparing the diet composition of both leopards. This
would make it easier to compare the two species and their diets. This
would help in visualizing if there is a higher chance for competition
between the leopards at different sites/elevations.

Alternatively, if they did not represent their statistics in a figure,
what kind of figure would you recommend to them? Describe the x- and
y-axes, with any geometries and aesthetics (colors, etc.). Provide
enough explanation such that someone would be able to create the figure
you describe in code. Provide explanations/justifications for the figure
you would recommend.
